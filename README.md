If you use Terralith and Croptopia, you might have an issue where crops don't spawn on the ground anywhere in the world. Tree-based crops still spawn normally. There's no way without cheating to get these crops or their seeds. This datapack adds all Croptopia seeds to grass loot tables so you can break grass to randomly get seeds.
